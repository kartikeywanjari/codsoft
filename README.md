Task 1
Titanic Survival prediction 
Titanic survival prediction is a data analysis and machine learning project that aims to determine the likelihood of passengers surviving the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. By analyzing a dataset containing information about passengers such as their age, gender, class, and more, machine learning algorithms can be applied to make predictions about whether a given individual would have survived or not. This project provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic and showcases the power of data science in historical and real-world scenarios.

Task 2 
Iris flower classification 
Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. The dataset typically includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of iris flowers, along with their corresponding species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica). Machine learning algorithms, especially classification algorithms, are applied to this dataset to train a model that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. This project serves as a fundamental introduction to classification algorithms and demonstrates how machine learning can be used to categorize and classify different types of objects based on their features.

Task 3 
Sales Prediction using python 
Sales prediction involves using historical sales data and various features to forecast future sales or revenue for a business or product. This is a common application in business analytics and machine learning. The basic idea is to analyze past sales patterns, taking into account factors such as time, seasonality, marketing efforts, and external variables (e.g., economic indicators), to make accurate predictions about future sales.
